The purpose of our Project is to study the different vulnerabilities 
that may occur in the election process according to the different designs of the front 
and back ends, and to prevent them.
 In a limited amount of time, we have reviewed the literature 
to find some prevention issues of SQL injection in the election process,
 as well as other security issues.
